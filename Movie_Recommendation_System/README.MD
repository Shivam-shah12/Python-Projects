Movie Recommendation System
This project is a movie recommendation system built using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and the cosine similarity algorithm. The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle's website.

Steps to Build:
Dataset Preprocessing:

The dataset was preprocessed to remove errors and make it suitable for analysis.
Feature Selection:

Features such as genres, cast, author, description, and tags were selected for analysis and recommendation.
Cosine Similarity Algorithm:

The cosine similarity algorithm was utilized to predict movie recommendations based on the selected features.
Recommendation Generation:

The system generates recommendations by calculating the similarity between movies using the cosine similarity metric.
Usage:
Clone Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
Run Recommendation System:

Execute the main script to generate movie recommendations.
Example:
python
Copy code
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('movie_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess dataset
# (Preprocessing steps)

# Select features
features = ['genres', 'cast', 'author', 'description', 'tags']

# Implement Cosine Similarity Algorithm
# (Implementation details)

# Generate Recommendations
# (Recommendation generation)

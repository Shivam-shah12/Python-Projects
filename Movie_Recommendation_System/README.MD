Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on various features such as genres, cast, author, description, and tags. It utilizes the cosine similarity algorithm to predict suitable recommendations for users.

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Kaggle dataset

## Steps to Build:

1. **Dataset Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset underwent thorough preprocessing to eliminate errors and ensure suitability for analysis.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Key features such as genres, cast, author, description, and tags were carefully chosen for analysis and recommendation.

3. **Cosine Similarity Algorithm:**
   - The recommendation system employs the cosine similarity algorithm to measure the similarity between movies and predict recommendations.

## Usage:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn
